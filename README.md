# Fqueue

[![Build status](https://github.com/lion24/fqueue/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/lion24/fqueue/actions/workflows/main.yml)

A collection of thread-safe queues in Golang.

Some of them might be very fast ;)

Idea is to implement a variety of those and benchmark them to see how they
compete with each others.
